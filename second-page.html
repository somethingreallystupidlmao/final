            Dear Christine, First of all, Thank you very much for the gift. I appreciate it. Second of all, who doesn't know how to write a letter? Well, It doesn't really matter.

            The chocolate was good. I don't usually eat chocolates but this was salty and sweet so I liked it, hehe. I was also discussing today how I needed a new lip balm so I got one just in time.

            And most important of all, thank you for the letter and the poem. You know, I cried reading it. I probably cried because it was so well thought of, but I just never take the time to think what I mean in your life. What I am to you from your perspective. Maybe I am good with words. But the main point remains. I'm reflecting on this and I just wanted to tell you from the bottom-bottom-BOTTOM of my heart, a very big and heartfelt Thank You. I don't need to say it nor do you, but this relationship and trust we've made is the most important thing to me. That's it. Oh! You also managed to say I love you without saying it, hehe. So here's my reply without having said it.
        </p>
